# Released or Not
###### v1.0.0
## About
RON is a simple script that helps you manage your Animes.  
It lets you request information from [HorribleSubs](https://horriblesubs.info/), and by doing so you can check if new episodes have been released.

## How to use
First you'll need to install two external libs, Colorama and Requests.  
*Colorama* will let Windows users run the script without much trouble (because of ANSI code).  
*Requests* is the project core lib, it'll request info from HorribleSubs.

`pip install colorama`  
`pip install requests`

Now you just need to clone this repo and use it, ez clap.
