# Released or Not

### What is it?
*Released or Not* is a simple program that helps you keep up with new Anime releases.

### How does it work?
It scrapes data from the web and stores them in a database file.  

### How can I use it?
After grabbing the newest release and making sure you have Python 3.7 or above installed, in the main directory, open terminal and type `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
That's it, you're good to go. You can do `python main.py --help` to see all the available commands.  

### Goals
- [x] Backup and shareable list
- [x] Integrated searching tool
- [x] Option to run 24/7
- [x] Show accumulated released episodes
- [x] Add description
